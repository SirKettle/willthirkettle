<h2>The professional me</h2>
<h3>I specialise in front-end/client-side development for web and mobile. I spend most of my time writing object oriented JavaScript but still love to get my css and html fix when I get the chance. I'm currently using AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3 and SASS working with responsive designs for multiple platforms. I have previous commercial experience with Backbone.js, node.js, requirejs, LESS (&amp; Twitter Bootstrap).</h3>
<p>Having come from a creative background I also have a keen eye for detail. Back in the day, I was in charge of a small creative development team working on multiple projects including consumer facing white labelled systems in both mortgage comparison and corporate social networking.</p>
<p>I am highly motivated, passionate about technology, approach challenges logically and grasp new ideas quickly.</p>

<h3>Well what do you want to know?</h3>
<p>I'm a very lucky boy - married to a pretty little thing called Vic and we have two lovely little boys. Harrison (3) who thinks he's the boss, likes pretending to be a horse and sings about rumpledoodles. Elliot (1) who can't stop climbing, won't sit still for more than 5 seconds and is in fact the boss.</p>
<p>I like keeping active, cycling, playing football and I'm an avid follower of the mighty Norwich City FC. #OTBC #NCFC</p>
<p>I like movies (who doesn't), love coffee, really love ale (the old man type although I don't currently have a beard) and in my spare time I like to keep up to date with the latest web trends / tech...</p>
